# RomCom

## Project Overview

  The goal for RomCom was to integrate skills acquired over the last 2 weeks at Turing to create a Browser app that can randomly generate romance novel covers with randomly assigned titles and taglines. To complete this project, we employed a working knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals, the DOM, event listeners, and event handlers. During this project we dove head-first into HTML and CSS and acquired a working proficiency in querying DOM elements and manipulating those same elements. We gained skills in using JavaScript Classes to create instances and pass in dynamic parameters and arguments.

When opening the app, you will be taken to the home view. On this page, you will see a randomly generated cover with a random title and tagline. You can click the "Show New Random Cover" button to generate a new random cover. If a particular cover strikes your fancy, click the "Save Cover" button to save it in the Saved Covers section. You can click the "View Saved Covers" button to see all of your currently saved covers.  
*Note: The "Save Cover" button will not save the cover to your machine. We recommend taking a screenshot to save your favorite covers to your computer!*

This page displays all of the covers that you have saved. If you would like to delete a cover, double-click on it. (Be careful, though, this is **permanent**!)

This form will allow you to create a custom cover to your specifications.  
##### Cover
Add the URL of the image of your choice. This image will be the background of your custom novel.
- Ex. http://www.website.com/myimage.jpg
##### Title
Write the full title of your custom novel.
- Ex. Opal Passions
##### Descriptors
Add two descriptors for your custom tagline. The tagline follows this format: A tale of *Descriptor 1* and *Descriptor 2*
- Example descriptors: passion, heartache, true love  

After all forms are filled, click the "Make My Book" button to view your new creation.  
This will take you back to the Home View, where you can save your new cover to the Saved Covers section, or generate new random covers.
